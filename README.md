# Whipped Cakes and Bakes

The Whipped Cakes and Bakes website was created for a dear friend of mine, Morrigan. The purpose of this website is to provide an additional source for her to showcase her work, promote her social media pages and to allow customers to get in touch.

Users of this website will be able to view prices, flavours of cakes, view photos of some of the work done at Whipped Cakes and Bakes, access links to social media and get in touch directly using the form section.
